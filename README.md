# Electricity Billing Machine
- In the current technological landscape, automation is significantly 
impacting society, with the realization of smart homes becoming increasingly 
plausible. 
- There is a growing demand from users for fully automated electronic 
products that can monitor the environment, control electric appliances, and 
communicate with the outside world. 
- This project focuses on the development 
of an automated Electricity Billing Machine (EBM), providing users with the 
ability to track their electricity consumption in terms of units and associated 
costs. 
- The aim is to create a model that simplifies traditional energy meters, 
incorporating additional features such as displaying due dates, incurred fines, 
and other relevant information.
- The primary goal of this project is to develop an advanced billing system 
that can precisely monitor and bill electricity consumption. 
- Going beyond traditional billing methods, the proposed system integrates advanced features to 
improve accuracy, flexibility, and user-friendliness. 
- Utilizing the capabilities of Verilog, a versatile hardware description language renowned for describing 
complex digital systems efficiently, our objective is to create a robust and 
adaptable solution seamlessly integrable into diverse electrical infrastructure 
environments

- Initially, the user has to enter his electricity meter number in the EBM to 
initialize it. If the entered meter is available in the database, EBM will display 
the number of units consumed by the user and the amount to be paid along with 
fine incurred due to late payment or any other reasons. If the user pays the 
amount, then it will be updated in the database and the EBM will be reset.
